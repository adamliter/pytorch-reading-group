# PyTorch Reading Group

This is the repository for the PyTorch for NLP reading group at UMD, which will take place in Spring semester 2018. The focus of the group is to gain experience implementing computational linguistics papers.

## Installation

To get started, download the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbarrow/pytorch-reading-group
```

To automatically download the requirements, you must have [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) installed (I highly recommend it for environment management).

```
cd pytorch-reading-group
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

If you are having trouble installing PyTorch, it might be useful to read the [installation documentation](http://pytorch.org/). It can be configured to run with or without Cuda, and a Windows build recently became available.

## Session 1: Feedforward Networks and Embeddings


## Session 2: RNN Language Models and Sequential Data


## Session 3: Seq2Seq and Attention


## Session 4: Parsing
